# OOGA Retrospective Discussion
### Names

Andy Demma, Ryan Wolfram, Manith, Luthria, Arman Shekarriz, Michael Habib

## Project's current progress
We are close to having our first working game, Mario. We have successfully parsed the input data, written almost all of the basic backend classes necessary for a basic game, and have a working connection between the backend and frontend. The frontend is not yet complete because of the backend’s inability to finish the necessary classes, but the basic classes have been made and implementation should be straightforward this week. We expect to have a basic Mario and Geometry Dash finished by the end of this sprint.

## Current level of communication

Right now our team has a functioning level of communication. Most of our communication happens over GroupMe and we meet either in person or on Zoom at least once a week

## Satisfaction with team roles

Everyone is satisfied with their team role. We have taken on an equal amount of work each and are able to separate our tasks into Model, View, Controller so that we can work well independently of each other

## Teamwork that worked well

* Responsiveness on the GroupMe was top notch

* Carving out time for discussion of important, core concepts for the project, i.e. JSON file formatting, planning discussions about APIs and explicit classes and methods to create, etc.


## Teamwork that could be improved

* Understanding what our specific responsibilities/deliverables are at any given time.



* Creating issues before we start working
  *We should be able to see what each other teammate is doing so we don't overlap in work
* Only assign yourself to issue once you’re working on the issue. Make it unassigned at first and list classes to be worked on.
* Text in GroupMe what classes you’re working on every time you start coding.


## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

* We will do a better job of planning out our work before we start working and sharing what classes we are going to work on. We will also merge changes more frequently so that no one is working on outdated code
