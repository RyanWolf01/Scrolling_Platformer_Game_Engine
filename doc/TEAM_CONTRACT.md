## As a project team, we promise to:
* respect each other's ideas and work
* communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project
  *be punctual
* Contribute time as well as EFFORT (don’t be silent in meetings)
* Own up to mistakes

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
* have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* report the issue in the Team Sprint Report
* work with the person who broke the agreement to understand how to avoid another occurrence in the future
    * ask for reason for the occurrence and how to improve

## Team Procedures
* when and how often to meet
*  at least once a week for everyone, at least twice a week per team (i.e. backend/frontend)
* preferred channel of communication (e.g., Zoom, e-mail, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.):
    * GroupMe
* preferred GIT workflow
* have at least one other person review a merge request before merging
* maybe separate branches for backend, frontend, controller


### Meetings
* how to communicate action items made during the meeting:
    * one person takes notes and creates a doc for each meeting
* policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it:
    * reports in GroupMe -> rest of members decide how to divide up the missing work and get the missing member back on track in a reasonable manner
* policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting:
    * majority vote for small decisions but by consensus for major decisions,  after discussing pros and cons for every possible choice
    * decide priorities based on system (i.e. backend decides their priorities, frontend decides separately)
* Have your 3 things ready for the meeting (what you’ve done, what you will do next, any problems you might have had)


### Communications
* decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?):
    * majority vote for small decisions but by consensus for major decisions
* response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours):
    * Respond within 4 hours always BUT if deadline is that day, respond within 2 hours
* policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates
    * keep a google doc of all meetings and what was decided at each meeting AS WELL AS all major decision and updates in the same doc

### Commitments
* what does it mean to work to the "best of your ability":
    * for all the time you put in, make sure you’re focused at that time on the task at hand, questioning every decision you make to ascertain it is the best possible decision at that time
* how to set internal deadlines:
    * make a to-do list every coding session to keep yourself on task
    * make a to-do list for each sprint for all your personal goals
* how to provide commitments others on the team can rely on
    * hold each other accountable with a schedule of tasks for each person to finish by the end of a sprint so you can track each member’s progress
* policy for resolving failure to meet commitments
    * team meeting to discuss how to ensure a team member is meeting commitments in the future -> was the problem that the member was too busy, got stuck on a problem, etc.


### Helping each other
* best ways to and when to ask for help
    * ask for help when you’re stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes
    * ask either individually or in the group chat on GroupMe -> just ask by text if the problem is small or get on Zoom if the problem is larger
* responses to team member asking for help
    * always be respectful and understanding, no matter how small the issue is
* how to support the team priorities
    * understand other commitments people have to other classes but also respect how much work other members are putting in so that you are meeting a satisfactory performance relative to your teammates
* how to suggest design changes for specific pieces of code
    * first, speak with the primary member responsible for the class/classes you want to refactor
    * then, discuss within the smaller group (i.e. backend/frontend) if the change is feasible/necessary
