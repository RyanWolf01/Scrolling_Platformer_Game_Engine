# OOGA Retrospective Discussion
### Names
Andy Demma, Michael Habib, Manith Luthria

## Project's current progress
Can run Mario with collisions, and automatically moving entities.
In the start screen, you can choose a level with a file chooser.

## Current level of communication
The Group Chat still works very well, and our git commits and issues assist the team in preventing merge conflicts.

## Satisfaction with team roles
All are satisfied

## Teamwork that worked well

* Team meetings are very well attended, and everyone is both vocal and listening during the meetings.

* Everyone knows what is expected of them, and each member keeps exceeding expectations in work and communication


## Teamwork that could be improved

* Text in the group chat when you create a merge request, to notify the team of what changed.

* Discuss when we are going to be available to meet rather than just calling a meeting (using when2meet for the weekend work)


## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

Asking other members of the team for things when you get stuck on a certain part of implementation or programming. Keep creating exceptions for your public methods so other teammates know what the result should be when the method is called.
