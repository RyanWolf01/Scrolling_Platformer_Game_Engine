# OOGA Example Games
### Team 9


## Super Mario Brothers

In this game, the character is controlled entirely by the player, 
and the speed of scrolling is controlled entirely by the player. 
There are obstacles and platforms and enemies for the user to navigate 
around. The player has lives and loses when all lives are lost. 
The player wins when they reach the end of the level.

## Geometry Dash

In this game, the game scrolls by itself and a block jumps through the level.
The user can only make the character jump, and it moves side to side by itself. 
The player wins when they reach the end of the level. This is nearly the same as 
Mario except the scrolling is automatic.

## Doodle Jump

Doodle Jump is a vertical game instead of horizontal. There are many platforms
for the character to jump off of. There are enemies that will make the player lose if they are hit,
and the player can also lose by falling off the bottom edge of the platform.
This is the same as the other two in that it has platforms, but it scrolls vertically. 
It has the same kind of enemies as Mario, that die when they are jumped on but kill you if they are collided
with in any other way.
