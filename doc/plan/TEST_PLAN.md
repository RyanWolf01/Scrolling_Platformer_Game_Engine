### Michael
* Test if ImmutableEntity actually restricts the data access of the EntityList from the view. For example,
test the methods available to the Entity returned by EntityList using reflection.
* Test the functionality of the living API on entities. For example, see if calling kill() on an Entity
that implements Alive actually causes the lives counter to go to 0.
* Test the functionality of the LifeIncrementer. For example, see if an entity that implements
  LifeIncrementer can increase the lives of the entity.
