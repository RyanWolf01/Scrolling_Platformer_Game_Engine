## Project Goals

* Andy Demma

* Manith Luthria
  I would like to learn more about encapsulation and wrapping data structures to promote cleaner code writing. I am learning to plan more before I begin to write code. I also hope to learn to use active methods more then getter/setter methods.

* Arman Shekarriz
  I would like to

* Ryan Wolfram
  I would like to use the good design principles that we’ve learned in this course. Namely, I want 
to make sure that our code completely follows the open-close principle in regard to adding new 
game entities and even types of games. I also want to be an active contributer during team
meetings and uphold high standards for good design of our code (which ultimately makes our lives
easier down the road).

* Michael Habib
  *In terms of teamwork, I hope to be more understanding of and open to other teammates’ ideas. On the technical side, I hope to plan data protection and control using encapsulation, interfaces, and records early on. Additionally, I hope to use more abstraction and have more complex hierarchies, making lower-level classes more active.


## Project Genres

* Possible genres
* Scrolling Platform
* Strategy Based
* Grid Based (tetris, etc.)
* Chosen genre
  *Scrolling platform games such as Super Mario Bros, Doodle Jump, Sonic, Geometry Dash

## Project Extensions

* Possible extensions
  *Online data storage (for leaderboards, save files, etc.), have user change design preferences, Race against past version (artificial player), load games, save games

* Chosen extensions
  *Online data storage (complex), preferences (basic), load and save game (basic) artificial player (basic)

## Project Effort Emphasis

Emphasis will be on mostly getting positive


## Team Name

## Project Roles

* Michael Habib
  *Backend -> entity design, data encapsulation and protection, movement classes

* Arman Shekarriz
  *Controller work and generalist -> doing JSON file handling, translation between front and backend that sends collision information to frontend to remove or change visual status of entities and vice verse for UI interactions, properties things with languages and
